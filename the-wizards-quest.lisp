;; In this game, you are a wizard's apprentice.  You'll explore the wizard's
;; house.  You can visit three different locations: a living room, an attic,
;; and a garden. You can look around, walk to different locations, pick up
;; objects, and perform actions on those objects (pending).  
;;

;; Association (a-)list for game location nodes.
;; Nodes contain a simple description of the location itself.

			 (attic (You are in the attic.
				 There is a giant welding torch in the corner.))))

;; Association (a-)list for game location edges.
;; Edges contain information of relative position to the key of the a-list,
;; as well as the object that connects the key of the a-list to each of the
;; datums it's paired to. 
;; 
;; e.g. there is an edge between the living room to the garden,
;;  which places the garden to the west of the living room, 
;;  accessible through the door.

;; ========================== Game Commands ==========================
;; Remember that because these functions depend on a global variable, they are
;; not in the "functional style," which denotes functions that are completely
;; determined by the inputs to that function, and which always give the same
;; output with respect to the same inputs. Functional syle functions are
;; functions in the mathematical sense.


;; The game's 'look' command.
;; Players use this function to describe the world around them.
(defun look ()
  (append (describe-location *location* *nodes*)
	  (describe-paths *location* *edges*)
	  (describe-objects *location* *objects* *object-locations*)))

;; The game's 'walk' command.
;; Players use this function to move around in the world.
;; Players can only walk to locations which are adjacent to them,
;; which are accessible toward specific directions.
(defun walk (direction)
  (let (
	;; Try to define the local variable 'next', by searching for
	;; a match for the parameter 'direction' in the directions 
	;; within the *edges* variable.
	(next (find direction 
		    (cdr (assoc *location* *edges*)) ;; this cdr yields the edge datums available from the current location
		     :key #'cadr)) ;; the cadr of the above list yields the direction through which the edge is established

	;; In essence, you're trying to see if you can find the direction you intend to walk through in the edges available
	;; from your current location.  If the above lookup fails, 'next' will be nil.  If it succeeds, 'next' will be the
	;; complete edge datum of the *edges* a-list (found by cdr, above).
	)

	(progn
	  (setf *location* (car next)) ;; the car of next is the new location you're walking toward
	  (look)) ;; auto-look at the next location once you've walked to it

	'(You cannot go that way.) ;; if next is nil, just return the message saying you can't walk in the chosen direction
