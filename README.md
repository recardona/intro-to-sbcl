Intro to SBCL
=============

Learning how to use the SBCL implementation of ANSI Common Lisp.  In truth, I am
not focusing on anything SBCL-specific, but I am using SBCL, so there may be
SBCL-specific idioms that I unknowingly rely on.

cd-db.lisp

A very simple database for CD's. (From Siebel's *Practical Common Lisp*)

guess-my-number.lisp
--------------------

Simple binary search guessing game. (From Barski's *Land of Lisp*)

the-wizards-quest.lisp
